In order to write a better simulation routine for highly bent (low radius of curvature) crystals, we need to analyze experimental data to discover the relationship between the curvature and the dechanneling of particles out of the crystal planes.

## Electronic dechanneling
Dechanneling caused by scattering with electrons can be approximately described by diffusion theory:
